electricity. Electricity is the single largest source of power 
for all kinds of machines used around the world. Electrical engineering
 is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and
 application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. The 
field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth 
century after commercialization of the electric telegraph and 
electrical power supply. It now covers a range of subtopics 
including power, electronics, control systems, signal processing
 and telecommunications. Opportunities for electrical engineers
 nationally and internationally are, Installation testing, Maintenance 
include research, higher studies, design, production, technical sales,
 power, water, railways & defense.</p></center>

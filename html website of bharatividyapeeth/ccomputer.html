			<p>Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to University) College of Engineering, Pune established on 9thAugust 1983 is one of the oldest and largest Engineering colleges in the state of Maharashtra. The college was affiliated to University of Pune (now known as Savitribai Phule Pune University).

The Department of Computer Engineering was established in 1985 and commencedwith the undergraduate programme of B.E (Computer Engineering) with an intake of60 under the University of Pune.In the year 2000, the institute came under the ambit of BharatiVidyapeeth DeemedUniversity and subsequently the intake of the programmewas also increased to 120 inthe same year.In this year the department also commencedwith the Post Graduate programme M.Tech (Computer Engineering) with an intake of18 under the ambits of BharatiVidyapeeth Deemed University.

The department has forged a path of innovation in research and teaching in the field of computing technologies at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The B.E. (Computer Engineering) program was accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA), in the year 2005 for three years. The nomenclature of the programme was changed to Bachelor of Technology B.Tech (Computer Engineering) in 2007 from B.E. (Computer Engineering). The changed nomenclature programme B.Tech (Computer Engineering) was reaccredited in 2012 for a period of 3 years. B. Tech. (Computer Engineering) program has been revised based on Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) and has been implemented since academic year 2014-15.

The main purpose for inception of the department was to syndicate the thoroughnessof science, power of engineering, and the ecstasy of innovation, empowering studentsto change the world.The Computer Engineering courses gives a sound grounding in the fundamentals ofcomputing along with an understanding of the underlying engineering principles. Thedepartment has forged a path of innovation in research and teaching in the field ofcomputing technologies at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Till date more than 3000 undergraduates and 400 Post graduates have graduated from the department. Through the year, students have pursued higher studies, turned successful entrepreneurs and attained high positions in the organizations of repute. This was mainly due to the qualitative education, stimulating exposure and versatility of knowledge they gained.

The spacious infrastructure, well equipped laboratories, meritorious students and academically qualified and enthusiastic faculty being the salient features of the Department.As technology develops in leaps and bounds, the opportunities for expanding the fieldof computing grow even more rapidly. The department has a well-established faculty development programme which is effectively implemented through which qualifications of faculty were upgraded. The department possesses qualified faculty, state-of-art infrastructure and its own library.

Apart from routine academic the department is associated with several other academic activities like conducting seminars, workshops, conferences, expert lectures etc. through which it updates the practical aspects through industry -institute interaction. A 45 days in plant training is integral part of the syllabi which gives exposure of industrial environment to the final year students.

To sustain and deliver the latest knowledge to the students faculties have also constantly upgraded their knowledge becoming highly qualified competent. Total five faculty members have completed Ph. D. in last three years, and three faculty members are pursuing Ph.D.

Research in the department crosses traditional boundaries and projects spring fromshared interests more than from established groups. The main thrust research areasinclude, Software Engineering, Storage Systems and Computer Architecture, ComputerNetworks, Big Data and Data Mining etc. The completed and ongoing research works are well supported by the research grants received by the faculty members from various government and autonomous funding agencies and university.The department has received a total research funding of approximately 15.19 lakh in last three years. Total 136 research papers have been published in national and international peerreviewedjournals and conferences of repute in last three years. It is note worth to mention theprominent department research citations listed in Google scholar – 541, Scopus – 35, web of science – 10.

As a result of Computer Engineering department initiative, the institute has received the status of VMware IT Academy which is reflected to be a Center of Excellence.

The department has its students association –Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES) to explore the talents of students related to technical as well as nontechnical activities. The department is also very active in social activities such as Tree plantation, Swacha Bharat Abhiyan, Visits to orphanage etc. Under the institutes unique imitative called, “Engagement of People in Science and Technology” faculty members and students visits the nearby schools and creates awareness among the students regarding the application of science and technology in the day to day life

Department have progressive data in the placement and higher studies. The students have been placed in software companies like Wipro, Infosys, Kanbay, TCS, Persistent, Emerson.

		<h1>Our Founder</h1>
		<img src="kadamsir.jpg" alt="Dr Patangrao Kadam"style="width:300px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;">
		<p>Dr. Patangrao Kadam came from a middle level farmer's family in a small village of Sangli District in Maharashtra. He was the first person from his village to have passed the S.S.C, examination. After S.S.C., he joined Shivaji College at Satara, run by Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, which was established by a renowned social reformer and educationist, Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil. He was enrolled in the College under its "earn and learn scheme". It is here that fine qualities of head and heart, which he is now known for, took root in him. He took lessons of dedicated social service at the feet of Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil.

Dr. Kadam came to Pune in 1961, where he completed one year Diploma Course in teaching and in 1962, started working as a part time teacher in a secondary school in Pune run by Rayat Shikshan Sanstha. Dr. Kadam obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Law and Master's degree from the University of Pune. Despite his pre-occupation with educational, social and political activities, Dr. Kadam completed his research on the theme "Administrative Problems of Educational Administration in 80s" for which he was awarded a Ph.D. in Management by the University of Pune.

Dr. Kadam established Bharati Vidyapeeth in 1964 when he was hardly 20 years old. From the beginning, his vision was to develop Bharati Vidyapeeth as a distinct educational institution. His vision and ambitions are reflected in the constitution, which was submitted to the Charity Commissioner at the time of registration of Bharati Vidyapeeth as a Trust, wherein he had included "to establish our own University", as one of the objectives of Bharati Vidyapeeth.

He cherished this ambition and visualized this possibility at a time when the concept of Deemed University was yet to emerge. Read more...</p><br>
